I think model dispatcher.py is important
Deal with the cat variables
Diff between label encoder and one hot encoding and in which model we have to use one?
#Other cat variables put links in the reference 
Feature engineering by combining features 
Train the model on different algorithms i) logistic Regression
                                        ii) rf
                                        iii)XgBoost Algorithm 

Make a api kind of service to see if its working fine or not 
Check the readme template in notion and try to paste the code if that works

We are going with the logres_model, as it has the highest accuracy factor
